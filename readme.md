check for permissions: 

<code>chmod +x src/cam_stream/cam_stream/camera_publisher.py</code>

list all active topics, check for something related to camera and image_raw
<code>ros2 topic list</code>


## how to view image
**Before you try to view the image feed, make sure that both the raspberry pi and the computer is on the same network. It cannot be any wustl network.**
